# Arduino LED Blink: Arduino API vs Register-Level Control

This project compares two methods of blinking the Arduino onboard LED (pin 13):

1. Using Arduino's high-level functions (`pinMode`, `digitalWrite`)
2. Using direct AVR register-level manipulation (`DDRB`, `PORTB`)

## Objective
- Blink the onboard LED at 1 Hz using both methods
- Compare execution time and memory overhead
- Observe behavior when blinking as fast as possible

## Key Observations
- Both methods successfully blink the LED at 1 Hz
- Register-level control executes faster due to direct hardware access
- When delays are removed, register-level blinking reaches a much higher frequency
- High-level Arduino functions introduce overhead due to abstraction layers

## Hardware
- Arduino Uno
- Onboard LED (Pin 13 / PB5)

## Notes
This project demonstrates the trade-off between code readability and execution efficiency in embedded systems.
